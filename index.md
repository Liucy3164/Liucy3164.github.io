# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Cheng-Yu Liu (Louis), a researcher passionate about quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum error correction. I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in theoretical quantum physics from National Taiwan University, where I conducted research in Prof. Guin-Dar Linâ€™s group, focusing on quantum optics and simulations. Afterward, I worked as a research assistant at NTU and later joined Academia Sinica as an assistant researcher under the mentorship of Dr. Hsiang-Hua Jen. I am currently seeking opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge research in quantum information science and technology.
