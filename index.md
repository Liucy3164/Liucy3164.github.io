# Hello! 👋

I’m Cheng-Yu Liu (Louis), a researcher passionate about quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum error correction. I earned my Master’s degree in theoretical quantum physics from National Taiwan University, where I conducted research on quantum optics and simulations in [Prof. Guin-Dar Lin](https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/guindarl.html)'s group. Afterward, I worked as a research assistant at NTU, and later joined Academia Sinica as an assistant researcher, working under the mentorship of [Dr. Hsiang-Hua Jen](https://www.iams.sinica.edu.tw/en/?link=member&id=61).
