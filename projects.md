# üõ†Ô∏è Projects

Here are some of the research and simulation projects I've worked on:

## 1. Simulation of Trapped Ion Micromotion Trajectories
Simulated the micromotion behavior of ions in a Paul trap to analyze their dynamics under RF fields. This work provides insights into optimizing trap parameters for stable confinement.

## 2. Simulation of Trapped Ion Phase Space Trajectories
Explored the classical and quantum phase space trajectories of ions under different external field conditions. Visualizations help clarify the ion‚Äôs state evolution during manipulation.

## 3. Novel Cavity-Mediated Gate Scheme
Designed and analyzed a new gate mechanism for quantum computing based on cavity QED. This scheme aims to achieve high-fidelity entangling operations using photonic interactions.
