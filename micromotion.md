# üåÄ Simulation of Trapped Ion Micromotion Trajectories

<img src="{{ 'graphs/micromotion.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Micromotion Trajectory" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; border-radius:12px;" />

Simulated the micromotion behavior of ions in a Paul trap to analyze their dynamics under radio-frequency (RF) fields.
This work enables deterministic control of ion trajectories, supporting scalable quantum computation in two-dimensional architectures.
