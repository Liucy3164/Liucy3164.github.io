# üõ†Ô∏è Projects 

Here are some of the research and simulation projects I've worked on: 


## [1. Simulation of Trapped Ion Micromotion Trajectories](/projects/micromotion/)

Simulated the micromotion behavior of ions in a Paul trap to analyze their dynamics under RF fields. This work provides insights into optimizing trap parameters for stable confinement.

üëâ [Mathematica Micromotion Trajectories](https://github.com/Liucy3164/Mathematica-Micromotion-trajectories)

This repo contains my `.nb` notebook so you can open it directly in Mathematica. 


## 2. Simulation of Trapped Ion Phase Space Trajectories 

Explored the classical and quantum phase space trajectories of ions under different external field conditions. Visualizations help clarify the ion‚Äôs state evolution during manipulation. 

## [3. Novel Cavity-Mediated Gate Scheme](/projects/refinedversion/) 

Designed and analyzed a new gate mechanism for quantum computing based on cavity QED. This scheme aims to achieve high-speed entangling operations using photonic interactions. 

## [4. Cavity‚Äìmotion gate scheme (early sketch)](\projects/cavitymotion/)

Theoretically analyzed a possible new gate by considering coupling between spin states, motional modes, cavity modes.  

## [5. Implementations of the BB84 protocol on IBM quantum hardware](/projects/BBA4/) 

## [6. Simulations on Error Analysis of Planar Ion Crystals and Ion Chains Implementing the Bacon‚ÄìShor Code (on going)](/projects/Bacon-Shorsim/) 

More projects coming soon!
