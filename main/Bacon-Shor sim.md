# ðŸ’» Simulations on Error Analysis of Planar Ion Crystals and Ion Chains Implementing the Baconâ€“Shor Code (on going)

Following https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adp2008, We begin interested in studying heating errors and gate speeds when implementing quantum circuits on 2D ion crystals or other ion structures. Below, we provide an analysis of a possible background setup for an 2D planar ion crystal with normal modes frequencies and participations for differnet ions.

We also note the potential of optical tweezers for controlling collective motional modes. In addition, we present a possible improvement in theoretical gate fidelity by introducing tweezers on
ions that are not directly involved in quantum gate operations.

Furthermore, we have implemented Baconâ€“Shor codes in Python using the Qiskit package, and we are interested in extending this work to simulate errors in full quantum circuits in the future. The details of this ongoing project are presented in the poster below.

At last, I am also interested in the mathematical framework for designing or improving possible error correcting circuits in the future.
