# ðŸ’» Simulations of gate sets for logical qubits encoded in bosonic qubits.

[1]: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00045-1

Following [[1]], one can examine my Julia code implementing the L-BFGS and Nelderâ€“Mead simulations of the logical X gate in a bosonic system. By modifying the definition of fidelity, the Hilbert-space dimension, and the maximum number of iterations (maxiter), one can simulate other gate sets or encoding processes.

This repository contains my Julia notebooks (`.ipynb`) for simulating gate sets of logical qubits encoded in bosonic modes.  
You can open the notebooks directly in Jupyter using the Julia kernel.
