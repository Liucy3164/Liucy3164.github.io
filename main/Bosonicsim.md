# ðŸ’» Simulations of gate sets for logical qubits encoded in bosonic qubits.

Following [[1]], one can examine my Julia code implementing the L-BFGS and Nelderâ€“Mead optimization methods for the logical X gate in a bosonic system. By representing the pulse shape as a Fourier series, I first determined the Fourier coefficients in a discrete manner, including high-frequency components up to fourty times the fundamental frequency. This allows the Fourier pulses to exhibit rapid and significant changes in amplitude. Subsequently, I compared the fidelities obtained from the discretized pulse shapes and from the continuous Fourier-series pulse constructed using the same optimized coefficients. The results show only negligible discrepancies.

By modifying the definition of fidelity, the Hilbert-space dimension, and the maximum number of iterations (maxiter), one can simulate other gate sets or encoding processes.

This repository contains my Julia notebooks (`.ipynb`) for simulating gate sets of logical qubits encoded in bosonic modes.  
You can open the notebooks directly in Jupyter using the Julia kernel.
