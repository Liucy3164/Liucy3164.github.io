# ðŸ’» Simulations of gate sets for logical qubits encoded in bosonic qubits.

Following [[1]], one can check my Julia code for the simulation of logical X gate in bosonic system. By changing the definition of fideity, one could perform other gate sets and encoding process.

This repository contains my Julia notebooks (`.ipynb`) for simulating gate sets of logical qubits encoded in bosonic modes.  
You can open the notebooks directly in Jupyter using the Julia kernel.
