This project presents a novel cavity-mediated controlled-Z gate protocol based on a three-stage process illustrated above. By modeling the system using the Tavis-Cummings framework and assuming an ideal laser shelving mechanism, an exact theoretical solution for the CZ gate is derived.

A key result shows that a second atom passing through the cavity with a coupling strength of `1/sqrt(3)` relative to the first atom leads to a perfect controlled-Z operation.

Further analysis and theoretical derivations are detailed in my Master's thesis:
